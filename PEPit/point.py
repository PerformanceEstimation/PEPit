    A :class:`Point` encodes an element of a pre-Hilbert space, either a point or a gradient.

    Attributes:
        name (str): A name set through the set_name method. None is no name is given.
        _is_leaf (bool): True if self is defined from scratch
                         (not as linear combination of other :class:`Point` objects).
                         False if self is defined as linear combination of other points.
        _value (nd.array): numerical value of self obtained after solving the PEP via SDP solver.
                           Set to None before the call to the method `PEP.solve` from the :class:`PEP`.
        decomposition_dict (dict): decomposition of self as a linear combination of leaf :class:`Point` objects.
                                   Keys are :class:`Point` objects.
                                   And values are their associated coefficients.
        counter (int): counts the number of leaf :class:`Point` objects.

    :class:`Point` objects can be added or subtracted together.
    They can also be multiplied and divided by a scalar value.

    Example:
        >>> point1 = Point()
        >>> point2 = Point()
        >>> new_point = (- point1 + point2) / 5

    As in any pre-Hilbert space, there exists a scalar product.
    Therefore, :class:`Point` objects can be multiplied together.

    Example:
        >>> point1 = Point()
        >>> point2 = Point()
        >>> new_expr = point1 * point2

    The output is a scalar of type :class:`Expression`.

    The corresponding squared norm can also be computed.

    Example:
        >>> point = Point()
        >>> new_expr = point ** 2
