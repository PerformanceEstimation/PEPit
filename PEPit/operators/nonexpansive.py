class NonexpansiveOperator(Function):
    """
    The :class:`NonexpansiveOperator` class overwrites the `add_class_constraints` method of :class:`Function`,
    implementing the interpolation constraints of the class of (possibly inconsistent) nonexpansive operators.

    Note:
        Operator values can be requested through `gradient`, and `function values` should not be used.

    Attributes:
        v (Point): infimal displacement vector.

    Nonexpansive operators are not characterized by any parameter, hence can be initiated as

    Example:
        >>> from PEPit import PEP
        >>> from PEPit.operators import NonexpansiveOperator
        >>> problem = PEP()
        >>> func = problem.declare_function(function_class=NonexpansiveOperator)

    Notes:
        Any nonexpansive operator has a unique vector called `infimal displacement vector`, which we denote by v.
        
        If a nonexpansive operator is consistent, i.e., has a fixed point, then v=0.

        If v is nonzero, a nonexpansive operator is inconsistent, i.e., does not have a fixed point.

        Note:
            Nonexpansive continuous operators are necessarily continuous, hence `reuse_gradient` is set to True.

            Setting self.v = None corresponds to case when a nonexpansive operator is consistent.
