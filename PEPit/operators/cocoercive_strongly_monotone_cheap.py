class CocoerciveStronglyMonotoneOperatorCheap(Function):
    """
    The :class:`CocoerciveStronglyMonotoneOperatorCheap` class overwrites the `add_class_constraints` method
    of :class:`Function`, implementing some necessary constraints verified by the class of cocoercive
    and strongly monotone (maximally) operators.

    Warnings:
        Those constraints might not be sufficient, thus the caracterized class might contain more operators.

    Note:
        Operator values can be requested through `gradient`, and `function values` should not be used.

    Attributes:
        mu (float): strong monotonicity parameter
        beta (float): cocoercivity parameter

    Cocoercive operators are characterized by the parameters :math:`\\mu` and :math:`\\beta`,
    hence can be instantiated as

    Example:
        >>> from PEPit import PEP
        >>> from PEPit.operators import CocoerciveStronglyMonotoneOperatorCheap
        >>> problem = PEP()
        >>> func = problem.declare_function(function_class=CocoerciveStronglyMonotoneOperatorCheap, mu=.1, beta=1.)
