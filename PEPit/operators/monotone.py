class MonotoneOperator(Function):
    """
    The :class:`MonotoneOperator` class overwrites the `add_class_constraints` method of :class:`Function`,
    implementing interpolation constraints for the class of maximally monotone operators.

    Note:
        Operator values can be requested through `gradient`, and `function values` should not be used.

    General maximally monotone operators are not characterized by any parameter, hence can be instantiated as

    Example:
        >>> from PEPit import PEP
        >>> from PEPit.operators import MonotoneOperator
        >>> problem = PEP()
        >>> h = problem.declare_function(function_class=MonotoneOperator)
