class LinearOperator(Function):
    """
    The :class:`LinearOperator` class overwrites the `add_class_constraints` method of :class:`Function`,
    implementing the interpolation constraints of the class of linear operators.

    Note:
        Operator values can be requested through `gradient`, and `function values` should not be used.

    Attributes:
        L (float): singular values upper bound
        T (Function): the adjunct linear operator

    Linear operators are characterized by the parameter :math:`L`, hence can be instantiated as

    Example:
        >>> from PEPit import PEP
        >>> from PEPit.operators import LinearOperator
        >>> problem = PEP()
        >>> M = problem.declare_function(function_class=LinearOperator, L=1.)
