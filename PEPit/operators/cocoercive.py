class CocoerciveOperator(Function):
    """
    The :class:`CocoerciveOperator` class overwrites the `add_class_constraints` method of :class:`Function`,
    implementing the interpolation constraints of the class of cocoercive (and maximally monotone) operators.

    Note:
        Operator values can be requested through `gradient`, and `function values` should not be used.

    Attributes:
        beta (float): cocoercivity parameter

    Cocoercive operators are characterized by the parameter :math:`\\beta`, hence can be instantiated as

    Example:
        >>> from PEPit import PEP
        >>> from PEPit.operators import CocoerciveOperator
        >>> problem = PEP()
        >>> func = problem.declare_function(function_class=CocoerciveOperator, beta=1.)
