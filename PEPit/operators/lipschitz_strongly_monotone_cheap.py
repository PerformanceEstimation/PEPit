class LipschitzStronglyMonotoneOperatorCheap(Function):
    """
    The :class:`LipschitzStronglyMonotoneOperatorCheap` class overwrites the `add_class_constraints` method
    of :class:`Function`, implementing some constraints (which are not necessary and sufficient for interpolation)
    for the class of Lipschitz continuous strongly monotone (and maximally monotone) operators.

    Note:
        Operator values can be requested through `gradient`, and `function values` should not be used.

    Warning:
        Lipschitz strongly monotone operators do not enjoy known interpolation conditions. The conditions implemented
        in this class are necessary but a priori not sufficient for interpolation. Hence, the numerical results
        obtained when using this class might be non-tight upper bounds (see Discussions in [1, Section 2]).

    Attributes:
        mu (float): strong monotonicity parameter
        L (float): Lipschitz parameter

    Lipschitz continuous strongly monotone operators are characterized by parameters :math:`\\mu` and `L`,
    hence can be instantiated as

    Example:
        >>> from PEPit import PEP
        >>> from PEPit.operators import LipschitzStronglyMonotoneOperatorCheap
        >>> problem = PEP()
        >>> h = problem.declare_function(function_class=LipschitzStronglyMonotoneOperatorCheap, mu=.1, L=1.)
