    Consider the monotone variational inequality

        .. math:: \\mathrm{Find}\\, x_\\star \\in C\\text{ such that } \\left<F(x_\\star);x-x_\\star\\right> \\geqslant 0\\,\\,\\forall x\\in C,

    where :math:`C` is a closed convex set and :math:`F` is maximally monotone and cocoercive. In this example, we use the characterization of
    cocoercive strongly monotone operators provided in [3, Proposition F.3] (which results in more computationnaly expensive PEPs to be solved).

    This code computes a worst-case guarantee for the **optimistic gradient method**.
    That, it computes the smallest possible :math:`\\tau(n)` such that the guarantee

        .. math:: \\|\\tilde{x}_n - \\tilde{x}_{n-1}\\|^2 \\leqslant \\tau(n) \\|x_0 - x_\\star\\|^2,

    is valid, where :math:`\\tilde{x}_n` is the output of the **optimistic gradient method**
    and :math:`x_0` its starting point.

    **Algorithm**: The optimistic gradient method is described as follows, for :math:`t \in \\{ 0, \\dots, n-1\\}`,
    
    .. math::
            :nowrap:

            \\begin{eqnarray}
                 \\tilde{x}_{t} & = & \\mathrm{Proj}_{C} [x_t-\\gamma F(\\tilde{x}_{t-1})], \\\\
                 {x}_{t+1} & = & \\tilde{x}_t + \\gamma (F(\\tilde{x}_{t-1}) - F(\\tilde{x}_t)).
            \\end{eqnarray}

    where :math:`\\gamma` is some step-size.

    **Theoretical guarantee**: The method and many variants of it are discussed in [1] and a PEP formulation suggesting
    a worst-case guarantee in :math:`O(1/n)` (when :math:`\\mu=0`) can be found in [2, Appendix D].
