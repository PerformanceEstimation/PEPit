def wc_cyclic_coordinate_descent(L, n, wrapper="cvxpy", solver=None, verbose=1):
    """
    Consider the convex minimization problem

    .. math:: f_\\star \\triangleq \\min_x f(x),

    where :math:`f` is :math:`L`-smooth by blocks (with :math:`d` blocks) and convex.

    This code computes a worst-case guarantee for **cyclic coordinate descent** with fixed step-sizes :math:`1/L_i`.
    That is, it computes the smallest possible :math:`\\tau(n, d, L)` such that the guarantee

    .. math:: f(x_n) - f_\\star \\leqslant \\tau(n, d, L) \\|x_0 - x_\\star\\|^2

    is valid, where :math:`x_n` is the output of cyclic coordinate descent with fixed step-sizes :math:`1/L_i`, and
    where :math:`x_\\star` is a minimizer of :math:`f`.

    In short, for given values of :math:`n`, :math:`L`, and :math:`d`, :math:`\\tau(n, d, L)` is computed as
    the worst-case value of :math:`f(x_n)-f_\\star` when :math:`\\|x_0 - x_\\star\\|^2 \\leqslant 1`.

    **Algorithm**:
    Cyclic coordinate descent is described by

    .. math:: x_{t+1} = x_t - \\frac{1}{L_{i_t}} \\nabla_{i_t} f(x_t),

    where :math:`L_{i_t}` is the Lipschitz constant of the block :math:`i_t`,
    and where :math:`i_t` follows a prescribed ordering.
