    """
    Consider the convex minimization problem

    .. math:: f_\\star \\triangleq \\min_x f(x),

    where :math:`f` is :math:`L`-smooth and convex.

    This code computes a worst-case guarantee for :math:`n` steps of the **gradient descent** method tuned
    according to the silver stepsize schedule.
    That is, it computes the smallest possible :math:`\\tau(n, L)` such that the guarantee

    .. math:: f(x_n) - f_\\star \\leqslant \\tau(n, L) \\|x_0 - x_\\star\\|^2

    is valid, where :math:`x_n` is the output of gradient descent using the silver step-sizes, and
    where :math:`x_\\star` is a minimizer of :math:`f`.

    In short, for given values of :math:`n`, and :math:`L`, :math:`\\tau(n, L)` is computed as the worst-case
    value of :math:`f(x_n)-f_\\star` when :math:`\\|x_0 - x_\\star\\|^2 \\leqslant 1`.

    **Algorithm**:
    Gradient descent is described by

    .. math:: x_{t+1} = x_t - \\gamma_t \\nabla f(x_t),

    where :math:`\\gamma_t` is a step-size of the :math:`t^{th}` step of the silver step-size schedule described in [1].

    **Theoretical guarantee**:
    The theoretical guarantee for the convergence rate of the silver stepsize can be found in [1, Theorem 1.1]:

    .. math:: f(x_n)-f_\\star \\leqslant \\frac{L}{1 + \\sqrt{4(1 + \\sqrt{2})^{2k}-3}} \\|x_0-x_\\star\\|^2,

    where :math:`k` is such that :math:`n = 2^k - 1`.
