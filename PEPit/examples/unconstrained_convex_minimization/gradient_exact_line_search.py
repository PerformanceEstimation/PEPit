    Consider the convex minimization problem

    .. math:: f_\\star \\triangleq \\min_x f(x),

    where :math:`f` is :math:`L`-smooth and :math:`\\mu`-strongly convex.

    This code computes a worst-case guarantee for the **gradient descent** (GD) with **exact linesearch** (ELS).
    That is, it computes the smallest possible :math:`\\tau(n, L, \\mu)` such that the guarantee

    .. math:: f(x_n) - f_\\star \\leqslant \\tau(n, L, \\mu) (f(x_0) - f_\\star)

    is valid, where :math:`x_n` is the output of the GD with ELS,
    and where :math:`x_\\star` is the minimizer of :math:`f`.
    In short, for given values of :math:`n`, :math:`L` and :math:`\\mu`,
    :math:`\\tau(n, L, \\mu)` is computed as the worst-case value of
    :math:`f(x_n)-f_\\star` when :math:`f(x_0) - f_\\star \\leqslant 1`.

    **Algorithm**:
    GD with ELS can be written as

        .. math:: x_{t+1} = x_t - \\gamma_t \\nabla f(x_t)

    with :math:`\\gamma_t = \\arg\\min_{\\gamma} f \\left( x_t - \\gamma \\nabla f(x_t) \\right)`.

    **Theoretical guarantee**: The **tight** worst-case guarantee for GD with ELS, obtained in [1, Theorem 1.2], is

        .. math:: f(x_n) - f_\\star \\leqslant \\left(\\frac{L-\\mu}{L+\\mu}\\right)^{2n} (f(x_0) - f_\\star).

    **References**: The detailed approach (based on convex relaxations) is available in [1],
    along with theoretical bound.
