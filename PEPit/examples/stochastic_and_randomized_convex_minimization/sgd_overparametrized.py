    Consider the finite sum minimization problem

    .. math:: F_\\star \\triangleq \\min_x \\left\\{F(x) \\equiv \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x)\\right\\},

    where :math:`f_1, ..., f_n` are :math:`L`-smooth and :math:`\\mu`-strongly convex. In the sequel, we use the notation 
    :math:`\\mathbb{E}` for denoting the expectation over the uniform distribution of the index
    :math:`i \\sim \\mathcal{U}\\left([|1, n|]\\right)`, e.g., :math:`F(x)\\equiv\\mathbb{E}[f_i(x)]`.
    In addition, we assume a zero variance at the optimal point (which is denoted by :math:`x_\\star`):

    .. math:: \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\|\\nabla f_i(x_\\star)\\|^2\\right] = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\|\\nabla f_i(x_\\star)\\|^2 = 0,
    
    where the expectation :math:`\\mathbb{E}` is taken over the uniform distribution of the index
    :math:`i \\sim \\mathcal{U}\\left([|1, n|]\\right)`.
    
    This kind of situations happens for example in machine learning in the interpolation regime,
    that is if there exists a model :math:`x_\\star`
    such that the loss :math:`\\mathcal{L}` on any observation :math:`(z_i)_{i \\in [|1, n|]}`,
    :math:`\\mathcal{L}(x_\\star, z_i) = f_i(x_\\star)` is zero.

    This code computes a worst-case guarantee for one step of the **stochastic gradient descent** (SGD) in expectation,
    for the distance to optimal point.
    That is, it computes the smallest possible :math:`\\tau(L, \\mu, \\gamma, n)` such that

    .. math:: \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\|x_1 - x_\\star\\|^2\\right] \\leqslant \\tau(L, \\mu, \\gamma, n) \\|x_0 - x_\\star\\|^2

    is valid, where :math:`x_1` is the output of one step of SGD.

    **Algorithm**: One iteration of SGD is described by:

    .. math::
        \\begin{eqnarray}
            \\text{Pick random }i & \\sim & \\mathcal{U}\\left([|1, n|]\\right), \\\\
            x_{t+1} & = & x_t - \\gamma \\nabla f_{i}(x_t),
        \\end{eqnarray}

    where :math:`\\gamma` is a step-size.

    **Theoretical guarantee**: An empirically tight one-iteration guarantee is provided in the code of PESTO [1]:

        .. math:: \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\|x_1 - x_\\star\\|^2\\right] \\leqslant \\left(\\max(1 - \\gamma\\mu, L\\gamma - 1\\right)^2 \\|x_0-x_\\star\\|^2.

    Note that we observe the guarantee does not depend on the number :math:`n` of
    functions for this particular setting, thereby implying that the guarantees are also valid for expectation
    minimization settings (i.e., when :math:`n` goes to infinity).

    **References**: Empirically tight guarantee provided in code of [1]. Using SDPs for analyzing SGD-type method was
    proposed in [2, 3].
