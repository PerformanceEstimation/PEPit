    """
    Consider the convex minimization problem

    .. math:: f_\\star \\triangleq \\min_x f(x),

    where :math:`f` is :math:`\\mu`-strongly convex.

    This code computes a worst-case guarantee for a **gradient** flow.
    That is, it computes the smallest possible :math:`\\tau(\\mu)` such that the guarantee

    .. math:: \\frac{d}{dt}\\mathcal{V}(X_t) \\leqslant -\\tau(\\mu)\\mathcal{V}(X_t) ,

    is valid, where :math:`\\mathcal{V}(X_t) = f(X_t) - f(x_\\star)`, :math:`X_t` is the output of
    the **gradient** flow, and where :math:`x_\\star` is the minimizer of :math:`f`.
    In short, for given values of :math:`\\mu`, :math:`\\tau(\\mu)` is computed as the worst-case value
    of the derivative :math:`f(X_t)-f_\\star` when :math:`f(X_t) -  f(x_\\star)\\leqslant 1`.

    **Algorithm**:
    For :math:`t \\geqslant 0`,

                .. math:: \\frac{d}{dt}X_t = -\\nabla f(X_t),

    with some initialization :math:`X_{0}\\triangleq x_0`.

    **Theoretical guarantee**:

        The following **tight** guarantee can be found in [1, Proposition 11]:

        .. math:: \\frac{d}{dt}\\mathcal{V}(X_t) \\leqslant -2\\mu\\mathcal{V}(X_t).

        The detailed approach using PEPs is available in [2, Theorem 2.1].
