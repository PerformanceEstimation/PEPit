    Consider the fixed point problem

    .. math:: \\mathrm{Find}\\, x:\\, x = Ax,

    where :math:`A` is a non-expansive operator, that is a :math:`L`-Lipschitz operator with :math:`L=1`.

    This code computes a worst-case guarantee for the **Krasnolselskii-Mann** method. That is, it computes
    the smallest possible :math:`\\tau(n)` such that the guarantee

        .. math:: \\frac{1}{4}\\|x_n - Ax_n\\|^2 \\leqslant \\tau(n) \\|x_0 - x_\\star\\|^2

    is valid, where :math:`x_n` is the output of the KM method, and :math:`x_\\star` is some fixed point of :math:`A`
    (i.e., :math:`x_\\star=Ax_\\star`).

    **Algorithm**: The KM method is described by

        .. math:: x_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{t + 2} x_{t} + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{t + 2}\\right) Ax_{t}.

    **Reference**: This scheme was first studied using PEPs in [1].
