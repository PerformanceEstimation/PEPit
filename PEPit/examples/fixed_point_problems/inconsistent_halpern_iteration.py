    Consider the fixed point problem

    .. math:: \\mathrm{Find}\\, x:\\, x = Ax,

    where :math:`A` is a non-expansive operator,
    that is a :math:`L`-Lipschitz operator with :math:`L=1`.
    When the solution of above problem, or fixed point, does not exist,
    behavior of the fixed-point iteration with A can be characterized with
    infimal displacement vector :math:`v`.

    This code computes a worst-case guarantee for the **Halpern Iteration**,
    when `A` is not necessarily consistent, i.e., does not necessarily have fixed point.
    That is, it computes the smallest possible :math:`\\tau(n)` such that the guarantee

    .. math:: \\|x_n - Ax_n - v\\|^2 \\leqslant \\tau(n) \\|x_0 - x_\\star\\|^2

    is valid, where :math:`x_n` is the output of the **Halpern iteration**
    and :math:`x_\\star` is the point where :math:`v` is attained, i.e.,

    .. math:: v = x_\\star - Ax_\\star

    In short, for a given value of :math:`n`,
    :math:`\\tau(n)` is computed as the worst-case value of
    :math:`\\|x_n - Ax_n - v\\|^2` when :math:`\\|x_0 - x_\\star\\|^2 \\leqslant 1`.

    **Algorithm**: The Halpern iteration can be written as

        .. math:: x_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{t + 2} x_0 + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{t + 2}\\right) Ax_t.

    **Theoretical guarantee**: A worst-case guarantee for Halpern iteration can be found in [1, Theorem 8]:

        .. math:: \\|x_n - Ax_n - v\\|^2 \\leqslant \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{Hn + 12} + 1}{n + 1}\\right)^2 \\|x_0 - x_\\star\\|^2.

    **References**: The detailed approach is available in [1].
