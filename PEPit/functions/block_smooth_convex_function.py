class BlockSmoothConvexFunction(Function):
    """
    The :class:`BlockSmoothConvexFunction` class overwrites the `add_class_constraints` method of :class:`Function`,
    by implementing necessary constraints for interpolation of the class of smooth convex functions by blocks.

    Warning:
        Functions that are smooth by blocks and convex generally do not enjoy known interpolation conditions.
        The conditions implemented in this class are necessary but a priori not sufficient for interpolation.
        Hence, the numerical results obtained when using this class might be non-tight upper bounds.

    Attributes:
        partition (BlockPartition): partitioning of the variables (in blocks).
        L (list): smoothness parameters (one per block).
        
    Smooth convex functions by blocks are characterized by a list of parameters :math:`L_i` (one per block),
    hence can be instantiated as

    Example:
        >>> from PEPit import PEP
        >>> from PEPit.functions import BlockSmoothConvexFunction
        >>> problem = PEP()
        >>> partition = problem.declare_block_partition(d=3)
        >>> L = [1, 4, 10]
        >>> func = problem.declare_function(function_class=BlockSmoothConvexFunction, partition=partition, L=L)

            Smooth convex functions by blocks are necessarily differentiable, hence `reuse_gradient` is set to True.
