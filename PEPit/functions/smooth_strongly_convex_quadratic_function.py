    """
    The :class:`SmoothStronglyConvexQuadraticFunction` class overwrites the `add_class_constraints` method of :class:`Function`,
    by implementing interpolation constraints of the class of smooth strongly convex quadratic functions.

    Attributes:
        mu (float): strong convexity parameter
        L (float): smoothness parameter

    Smooth strongly convex quadratic functions are characterized by parameters :math:`\\mu` and `L`,
    hence can be instantiated as

    Example:
        >>> from PEPit import PEP
        >>> from PEPit.functions import SmoothStronglyConvexQuadraticFunction
        >>> problem = PEP()
        >>> func = problem.declare_function(function_class=SmoothStronglyConvexQuadraticFunction, mu=.1, L=1.)
