    Consider the convex minimization problem

    .. math:: f_\\star \\triangleq \\min_x f(x),

    where :math:`f` is :math:`L`-smooth by blocks (with :math:`d` blocks) and convex.

    This code computes a worst-case guarantee for **gradient descent** with fixed step-size :math:`1/\\max_i L_i`.
    That is, it computes the smallest possible :math:`\\tau(n, L)` such that the guarantee

    .. math:: f(x_n) - f_\\star \\leqslant \\tau(n, L) \\|x_0 - x_\\star\\|^2

    is valid, where :math:`x_n` is the output of gradient descent with fixed step-size, and
    where :math:`x_\\star` is a minimizer of :math:`f`.

    In short, for given values of :math:`n`, and :math:`L`, :math:`\\tau(n, L)` is computed as the worst-case
    value of :math:`f(x_n)-f_\\star` when :math:`\\|x_0 - x_\\star\\|^2 \\leqslant 1`.

    **Algorithm**:
    Gradient descent is described by

    .. math:: x_{t+1} = x_t - \\frac{1}{\\max_i L_i} \\nabla f(x_t),

    where :math:`L_i`'s are the Lipschitz constants.

    **Theoretical guarantee**:
    A **tight** theoretical guarantee can be found in [1, Theorem 3.1]:

    .. math:: f(x_n)-f_\\star \\leqslant \\frac{\\max_i L_i}{4n+2} \\|x_0-x_\\star\\|^2.
