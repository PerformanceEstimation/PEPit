What's new in PEPit 0.4.1
=========================

New features:
-------------

- One can now disable some software verification tools (licensing, installation, etc) to allow for fast processing time (via boolean option safe_mode).

- Constraints (scalar and LMI) can now be deactivated using the `deactivate` method and activated back using the `activated` method. Note the PEP can be solved several times with different activated constraints. The method `solve` only creates the interpolation constraints once for all.

New demo:
---------

- The file `ressources/demo/PEPit_demo_extracting_a_proof.ipynb` contains an example usage of the new :class:`Constraint` feature.

Fixes:
------

- The :class:`SmoothQuadraticLojasiewiczFunctionExpensive` has been improved with slightly cheaper formulations.

- An integer overflow (due to previously specified dtype=int8) in :class:`MosekWrapper` has been fixed.

- The method `add_constraints_from_two_lists_of_points` of the class :class:`Function` has been fixed. So far, it was assumed that the two lists were identical.
