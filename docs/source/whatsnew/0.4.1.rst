What's new in PEPit 0.4.1
=========================

- Improvement: The :class:`SmoothQuadraticLojasiewiczFunctionExpensive` has been improved with slightly cheaper formulations.

- Added uselessly complexified tests to verify numerically that the formulations are in line.

- Fix: An integer overflow (due to previously specified dtype=int8) in :class:`MosekWrapper` has been fixed.
