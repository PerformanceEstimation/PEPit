What's new in PEPit 0.4.1
=========================

- Improvement: The :class:`SmoothQuadraticLojasiewiczFunctionExpensive` has been improved with slightly cheaper formulations.

- Added uselessly complexified tests to verify numerically that the formulations are in line.

- Fix: An integer overflow (due to previously specified dtype=int8) in :class:`MosekWrapper` has been fixed.

- New: one can disable some software verification tools (licensing, installation, etc) to allow for fast processing time (via boolean option safe_mode).
