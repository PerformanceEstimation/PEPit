What's new in PEPit 0.4.1
=========================

New features:
-------------

- New: one can disable some software verification tools (licensing, installation, etc) to allow for fast processing time (via boolean option safe_mode).

- Constraints (scalar and LMI) can now be deactivated using the `deactivate` method and activated back using the `activated` method.
Note the PEP can be solved several times with different activated constraints.
The method `solve` only creates the interpolation constraints once for all.

Fixes:
------

- The :class:`SmoothQuadraticLojasiewiczFunctionExpensive` has been improved with slightly cheaper formulations.

- An integer overflow (due to previously specified dtype=int8) in :class:`MosekWrapper` has been fixed.
