What's new in PEPit 0.3.3
=========================

- Silver step-sizes have been added in the `PEPit.examples.unconstrained_convex_minimization <https://pepit.readthedocs.io/en/0.3.2/examples/a.html>`_ module.

- An monotone inclusion example has been added in the `PEPit.examples.monotone_inclusions_variational_inequalities <https://pepit.readthedocs.io/en/0.3.2/examples/e.html>`_ module. It covers parameterized frugal resolvent splittings, including the Malitsky-Tam algorithm, Douglas-Rachford, the Ryu Three Operator Splitting, and a set of novel block splitting methods. This example compares a fixed step size for this class with one optimized using the dual of the PEP.

- A fix has been added in the class :class:`SmoothStronglyConvexQuadraticFunction`. Prior to that fix, using this class without stationary point in a PEP solved with the direct interface to MOSEK was problematic due to the late creation of a stationary point. After this fix, a stationary point is automatically created when instantiating this class of functions.

- Another modification has been made to the class :class:`SmoothStronglyConvexQuadraticFunction`. Prior to that, the minimum value was assumed to be 0. This is not the case anymore.
