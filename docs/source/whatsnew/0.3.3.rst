What's new in PEPit 0.3.3
=========================

- Silver step-sizes have been added in the PEPit.examples.unconstrained_convex_minimization module.

- A fix has been added in the class :class:`SmoothStronglyConvexQuadraticFunction`. Prior to that fix, using this class without stationary point in a PEP solved with the direct interface to MOSEK was problematic due to the late creation of a stationary point. After this fix, a stationary point is automatically created when instantiating this class of functions.

- Another modification has been made to the class :class:`SmoothStronglyConvexQuadraticFunction`. Prior to that, the minimum value was assumed to be 0. This is not the case anymore.

- The support of functions of the class :class:`ConvexIndicatorFunction` can be constrained through a radius in addition to a diameter.
