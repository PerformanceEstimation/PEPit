What's new in PEPit 0.3.2
=========================

For users:
----------

- Silver step-sizes have been added in the PEPit.examples.unconstrained_convex_minimization module.

- An monotone inclusion example has been added which covers parameterized frugal resolvent splittings, including the Malitsky-Tam algorithm, Douglas-Rachford, the Ryu Three Operator Splitting, and a set of novel block splitting methods. This example compares a fixed step size for this class with one optimized using the dual of the PEP.
