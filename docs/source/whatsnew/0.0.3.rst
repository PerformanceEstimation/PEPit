What's new in PEPit 0.0.3
=========================

- The `tracetrick` option of the method ``PEP.solve`` has been renamed `dimension_reduction`,
and the 3 parameters `dimension_reduction_heuristic`, `eig_threshold` and `tol_dimension_reduction`
have been introduced.

- CVXPY solver options can be provided to the method ``PEP.solve`` directly.

- The method ``add_constraint`` has been added to the class ``PEP`` and should be preferred to
the method ``set_initial_condition`` when the constraint is not the initial one
but still independent of the different functions.

- The attributes ``null_point`` and ``null_expression`` have been added to the class ``PEP``
to facilitate the access to a ``Point`` or an ``Expression`` initialized to 0.

- The verbose mode of the method ``PEP.solve`` and of the provided examples files
are now integers, allowing a bigger granularity.

- The parameters that caracterize a function class must be provided directly as an argument of this function class,
not through the dict "param" anymore.
Example: `PEP.declare_function(function_class=SmoothStronglyConvexFunction, mu=.1, L=1.)`
